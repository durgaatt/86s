1.How do we call module inside a module in terraform ?
-->A module is called inside another module using the module block, and communication happens strictly through input variables and output values, 
which automatically creates the dependency order in Terraform.

2.How do you recover statefile in terraform ?
-->Terraform state can be recovered by restoring it from a backend (like S3 with versioning), a local state backup, 
or by re-importing existing resources using terraform import.

3.How do you manage your terraform architecture in your environment ?
--> We manage Terraform architecture using a modular design with reusable modules, environment-specific configurations, remote state backends, 
and CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistency, scalability, and safe deployments.
                             or
--> In our environment, we follow a modular Terraform architecture where core infrastructure components like VPC, IAM, and compute are built as reusable modules. 
Each environment (dev, test, prod) has separate state files managed through a remote backend such as S3 with DynamoDB locking. 
We use variables and workspaces or environment folders to isolate configurations, enforce versioning for providers and modules, and run Terraform through CI/CD pipelines with plan and approval stages to avoid manual changes and state conflicts.
